Fossology-Ninka UI mockups
==========================
This folder contains mockups that demonstrate how to use FOSSology-Ninka on the command line and on the web (once both are implemented).

These mockups are basically a slideshow set of pictures. See the [walkthrough document](https://github.com/TheFinks/Fossology-Ninka/blob/master/ui_mockups/command_line/Mockup_Walkthrough.docx) for explanation of each slide.

web

A sample web-based scanner front-end. Does not include presentation of results at this time.
