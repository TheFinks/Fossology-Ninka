  - The scanner how handles [zip files](https://github.com/TheFinks/Fossology-Ninka/issues/11) correctly.
  - [Jon](https://github.com/jvonkampen0) thought it was simple to switch to Python 3. [Not](https://github.com/TheFinks/Fossology-Ninka/issues/6) [quite](https://github.com/TheFinks/Fossology-Ninka/issues/5). We're sticking to Python 2 for now.
